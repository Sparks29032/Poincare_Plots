### Damped, Oscillatorily Driven Pendulum
A ball of mass $m$ is attached to a stiff, but massless rod of length $l$. Gravity acts on it, providing a force $-mg\sin(\theta)$ perpendicular to the rod. The pendulum is also damped by a force $-\gamma\omega$ and driven by an oscillatory force $F_0\cos(\omega_dt)$. Thus, the equations of motion are
\[ml\alpha = -mg\sin(\theta) - \gamma\omega + F_0\cos(\omega_dt)\]
